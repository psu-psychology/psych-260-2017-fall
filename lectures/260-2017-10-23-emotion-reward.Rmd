## Today's Topics

- Biology of emotion
- Happiness/pleasure
- Quiz 3 Friday

## Biology of Emotion

- What is emotion?
- What are the types of emotions?
- Biological systems involved in emotion

## What is emotion?

- Feelings
- Physiological state
- Actions (now)
- Propensity to act (in the future)

## What is cause? What is effect?

<div class="centered">
> "Do we run from a bear because we are afraid or are we afraid because we run? William James posed this question more than a century ago, yet the notion that afferent visceral signals are essential for the unique experiences of distinct emotions remains a key unresolved question at the heart of emotional neuroscience."

[[@Harrison2010-nx]](http://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1725-10.2010)

## Competing views

- James-Lange
    - Physiological response -> subjective feelings
- Cannon-Bard
    - Severing CNS (spinal cord & vagus) from rest of body leaves emotional expression unchanged
    - Physiological states slow, don't differentiate among emotions 
- Schacter-Singer
    - Physiological arousal + cognitive appraisal -> emotional states

## What are the different types of emotions?

Pessoa noted that from a network perspective, the amygdala is among the most centrally connected parts of the brain. It's a 'hub', in other words.

*Here, I will argue that complex cognitive–emotional behaviours have their basis in dynamic coalitions of networks of brain areas, none of which should be conceptualized as specifically affective or cognitive. Central to cognitive–emotional interactions are brain areas with a high degree of connectivity, called hubs, which are critical for regulating the flow and integration of information between regions.*

*...The study distinguished 31 manual gestures and 18 facial/vocal signals. It was found that homologous facial/vocal displays were used very similarly by both [bonobos and chimpanzees], yet the same did not apply to gestures. Both within and between species gesture usage varied enormously. Moreover, bonobos showed greater flexibility in this regard than chimpanzees and were also the only species in which multimodal communication (i.e., combinations of gestures and facial/vocal signals) added to behavioral impact on the recipient.*

- Autonomic specificity: emotions autonomically unique vs. autonomically identical? [[@levenson_autonomic_2003]](http://conium.org/~ucbpl/docs/72-Autonomic%20Specificity03.pdf)

>> *We propose that emotions are represented in the somatosensory system as culturally universal categorical somatotopic maps. Perception of these emotion-triggered bodily changes may play a key role in generating consciously felt emotions.*

## Rewards

- A *reward* reinforces (makes more prevalent/probable) some behavior
- Milner and Olds [[@milner_discovery_1989]](http://doi.org/10.1016/S0149-7634(89)80013-2) discovered 'rewarding' power of electrical self-stimulation
- [[@heath1963electrical]](http://doi.org/10.1176/ajp.120.6.571) studied effects in human patients.

## Electrical self-stimulation

## "Reward" circuitry in the brain

<div class="centered">
<img src="img/nestler-fig-1.jpg" height=450px>

[[@nestler2006mesolimbic]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.09.018)
</div>

<div class="notes">
The accidental discovery that electrical stimulation could be pleasurable launched a research program into the circuits that control both pleasure and positive feelings. The electrical stimulation involved a path from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the ventral striatum -- the anterior-most part of the caudate and putamen nuclei of the basal ganglia.
</div>

## Nodes in the "reward" circuit

- Ventral tegmental area (VTA) in midbrain
- Nucleus accumbens (nAcc)

- Hypothalamus (Hyp)
- Amygdala (Amy)
- Hippocampus (HP)
- Dorsal Raphe Nucleus/Locus Coeruleus (DR/LC)
- Prefrontal cortex (PFC)

<div class="notes">
Other nodes in this "reward" network include...

## Nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum

</div>

<div class="notes">
Here's another view of some of the circuits involved in pleasure/reweard that shows their interconnections. Here, the nucleus accumbens is called the ventral striatum (VS).
</div>

## Psychopharmacology of 'happiness'

- Dopamine
- Opioids
- Cannabinoids
- Serotonin, Norepinephrine
- ACh

<div class="notes">
The network involved in pleasure/reward involves a distinct set of neurotransmitters: dopamine, opioids, cannabinoids, serotonin and norepinephrine, and acetylcholine.
</div>

## Endogenous morphine-like NTs (endorphins) from hyp, NST

<div class="centered">
<img src="img/endorphins-niaa.gif" height=450px>

[[@clapp-niaa]](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh314/310-339.htm)
</div>

<div class="notes">
Researchers in the 1970s first discovered that there were *endogenous* chemicals in the brain that had similar chemical properties to opioid drugs like heroin and morphine. These substances were later shown to be neurotransmitters. So, the brain releases its own *endogenous morphine-like* substances or endorphins. Endorphins bind to receptors that also bind exogenous drugs like heroin.
</div>

## Endogenous cannabinoid system

- Cannabinoids, psychoactive compounds found in cannibis
- Cannabinoid CB1 receptors in CNS; CB2 in body, immune system

[[@flores_cannabinoid-hypocretin_2013]](http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2013.00256)
</div>

<div class="notes">
Later, researchers discovered that the brain has an endogenous cannabinoid system that exogenous substances like marijuana and hashish bind to. Receptors for cannabinoids are found all over the brain and body.
</div>

## Brain contains its own systems for binding drugs associated with 'pleasure'

- Endogenous opioids (endorphins)
- Endogenous cannabinoids

<div class="notes">
This means that the brain contains its own receptors for substances that are known as drugs of pleasure.
</div>

## ACh projections in the CNS

[[@cock_sleep_2008]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncpneuro0775)
</div>

<div class="notes">
Acetylcholine also plays a role in the pleasure/reward circuit. We've talked about ACh as the primary NT of CNS output, but it is also a neuromodulator that projects widely, including from the nucleus accumbens (basal forebrain BF), and the dorsal raphe (DR: NE), and locus coeruleus (LC: 5-HT) in the brainstem.
</div>

## Generalizations about happiness/pleasure

- Types of pleasure activate overlapping areas
- Pleasure/happiness engage a network of brain areas
- Pleasure/happiness signaling involves multiple neuromodulators, but DA especially important
- “Reward” pathways activated by many different inputs.

## Next time

- Fear
- Stress
