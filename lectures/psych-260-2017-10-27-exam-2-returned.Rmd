## Please put in their proper order the steps that lead to synaptic communication between neurons. Begin with the *presynaptic* cell.

---

- Voltage-gated Ca++ channels open.
- Ca++ flow initiates exocytosis of neurotransmitter.
- Action potential propagates down the axon to the axon terminal.
- Ligand-gated receptors bind neurotransmitter and activate channels in the postsynaptic cell.
- Neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft.
